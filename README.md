# Web Fragments

Web Fragments are a radically new approach to Web Micro-frontends which is framework and platform agnostic. New to micro-frontends? Check out https://microfrontend.dev

This project is an early phase, but we are working on launching it for production use at Cloudflare very soon.

Documentation is scarce right now, but you can check out the demos present in this repository. The best place to start is [e2e/pierced-react/README.md](e2e/pierced-react/README.md)

We blogged about the philosophy of our approach and published some early research on the Cloudflare blog. You can check out a post introducing the previous generation of Web Fragments: https://blog.cloudflare.com/better-micro-frontends.

We also blogged about how Web Fragments can enable incremental adoption of micro-frontends: https://blog.cloudflare.com/fragment-piercing
> Incremental adoption of micro-frontends with Cloudflare Workers
> 
> Large frontend applications are often hard to improve without major investments. With Cloudflare Workers, our fragment-based micro-frontend architecture, and fragment piercing technique, engineering teams can incrementally improve large frontends in a fraction of the time, yielding significant user and developer experience gains.

This research and development is sponsored by Cloudflare:
